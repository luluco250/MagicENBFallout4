# Magic ENB for Fallout 4

## Description

My own set of shaders for ENB for Fallout 4. This preset aims for *actual* realism and performance. If your game runs at a solid 60 FPS on vanilla, it'll continue to do so under these effects.

This is a work in progress, so not all shaders are complete and some things might break or not be optimized enough.
It's completely usable though.

## Current Features
* ACES filmic tonemapping, like Unreal 4.
* High quality adaptation, featuring highly contrasting lights and shadows.
* Physically-correct bloom with very smooth blurring.
* WIP SMAA implementation in the depth of field shader.
* Various post-processing features, like brightness, contrast, saturation and temperature controls, as well as vignette, chromatic aberration and film grain.

## Installation
To install, simply install the original ENB preset (from enbdev.com) and copy-paste my files over it, replacing all existing files.

## Keymaps/Shortcut Keys
* F10: Disable/Enable ENB
* F12: Show/Hide ENB Menu
* PrintScreen: Take Screenshot
